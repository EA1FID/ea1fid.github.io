This design started as a solution to a problem that alots of amateur radi operators specialised in microwave bands face every time they want to operate on 2,4GHz: due to the small bandwidth of most antennae designed for the QO-100 satellite, it is mandatory to have different dish feeders depending on whether you want to work the geostationary transponder or make some terrestrial QSOs at the lower part of the band.</description></item><item><title>A dielectric lens for the 10,5GHz band (QO-100)</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-06-lente/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-06-lente/</guid><description>In this post, we would like to share our design of a dielectric lens for the 10,5GHz band. It has been optimised for its use with commercial satellite dishes of f/D of 0,4, achieving optimal efficiency with respect to reflector illumination (-12dB of illumination at its edges).</description></item></channel></rss>
