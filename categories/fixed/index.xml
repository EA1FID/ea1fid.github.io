This design started as a solution to a problem that alots of amateur radi operators specialised in microwave bands face every time they want to operate on 2,4GHz: due to the small bandwidth of most antennae designed for the QO-100 satellite, it is mandatory to have different dish feeders depending on whether you want to work the geostationary transponder or make some terrestrial QSOs at the lower part of the band.</description></item><item><title>Xurelo-6: an easy and portable alternative for working the 50MHz / 6m band</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-30-xurelo-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-30-xurelo-6/</guid><description>The successor of the Xurelo-4 is here!

It has been optimised for its use with commercial satellite dishes of f/D of 0,4, achieving optimal efficiency with respect to reflector illumination (-12dB of illumination at its edges).</description></item><item><title>Xurelo-4: working the 70MHz / 4m band on-the-go</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-06-15-xurelo-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-06-15-xurelo-4/</guid><description>We are presenting our new antenna for the 4m / 70MHz band: Xurelo-4.
There is not a lot of people into the 4m band, mainly because of it not being allocated for Amateur Radio use in several contruies.</description></item><item><title>Ollmol: a modern approach to Small Station EME</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-04-22-ollomol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-04-22-ollomol/</guid><description>Ollomol is our first antenna for the 23cm band. However, it is part of a very interesting amateur radio experiment: designing smaller antennae that can achieve Earth-Moon-Earth communications.</description></item><item><title>Raposo-70: redefining 70cm Yagis</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-02-06-raposo-70/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-02-06-raposo-70/</guid><description>Thanks to the experience obtaing thought the different design stages of Raposo-2, we are glad to annouce the new member to the family: Raposo-70.</description></item><item><title>Raposo-2: an open-source LFA low-noise yagi for the 2m band</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-01-12-raposo-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-01-12-raposo-2/</guid><description>While Yagis using a folded dipole as the radiant element have been part of television systems since decades, they only started arriving at the amateur radio comunity some years ago.</description></item><item><title>Xurelo-2: bringing 2m DX to everybody</title><link>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2020-08-14-xurelo-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:19:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2020-08-14-xurelo-2/</guid><description>Xurelo-2 is the ideal antenna for those who want a high-gain and easy to build antenna for the 2m band which allows them to work DX.</description></item></channel></rss>
