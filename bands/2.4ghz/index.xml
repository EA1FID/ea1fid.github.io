This design started as a solution to a problem that alots of amateur radi operators specialised in microwave bands face every time they want to operate on 2,4GHz: due to the small bandwidth of most antennae designed for the QO-100 satellite, it is mandatory to have different dish feeders depending on whether you want to work the geostationary transponder or make some terrestrial QSOs at the lower part of the band.</description></item></channel></rss>
