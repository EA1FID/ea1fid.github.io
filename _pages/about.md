At FIDtenas, we defend the evolution and progress of the *maker* comunity though the use of Open-source hardware. We understand that the design of efficient electromagnetic systems is a complex job that requires some levels of knowledge and expertise that are not available to the hobbyist. In this way, we want to freely offer the design of multiple antenna systems, with the aim of bringing contemporary and state-of-the-art models to the amateur user.

Our work is mainly focused on Amateur Radio frequency bands, starting on the 6m/50MHz section up to microwave frequencies. Since we have experience in this field, it is easier for us to stablish the requirements our antennae must fulfill and the specifications that will impact the most on their final behaviour, ensuring this way the best performance for this application.
