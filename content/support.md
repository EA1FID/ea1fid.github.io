#### Our mission

The main goal of FIDtenas in provinding open-source material to the Amateur Radio community. 

As amateur radio lovers, we hate watching our hobby dying without doing anythins about it: the very few advances in the last decades, the extremely high-priced equipment, the incredibly disperse information around more than 20 year old wbpages, the very few online resources and the rejection to embrace both other related communities (i.e.: the hacker community) and other technological advances (new digimodes, online radio operation, few microwave enthusiasts...) create a set of circunstances that move our passion away from newcommers and radio enthusiasts. 

In an attempt to fix this, from FIDtenas, we decided to offer free designs with plans, 3D printable parts and building guides for all different types of antennae (and other material soon!), never forgetting about using easy-to-find and cheap materials, so that anyone can simply download the corrsponding files, buy some threaded rods at their local hardware store and start enjoying ham radio. 

We also implement the philosophy of open-source: we freely share our knowledge about antenna and RF, since not everybody has the required experience and expertise to design a radiant system on his own, but we also embrace improvements made by other users around the internet. We are open to modify our designs, correcting bugs and improving their specifications so that, thanks to the collaboration of different radio enthusiasts around the Globe, we can offer even better antennae!


#### Our project

There is no perfect antenna. It is not possible to achieve maximal specifications for both bandwidth, gain, SLL, SWR, F/B, etc. at the same time, and we know that. Unlike most of antenna sellers, which tend to either hide the specifications that are not convenient for them or presenting diagrams with the axis adjusted so that the antenna seems better than what it actually is, we simply present all of the specifications and diagrams as they really are. We admit that every antenna will have its downsides, but we design them so that they are negligible for the specific application the antenna is going to be used for. For example, for a low-noise antenna, we will optimise the SLL, whereas this parameter will not be a priority in antenna diesigned for portable use. This is how antenna design work and we do no thide it!


#### How to help

Since we have no incomes, it sometimes feels difficult to find the necessary time and financing for the design processes. However, we included a donation system so that, in case you like this project and want to support it, you can do it in an easy way. Helping by buying a simple coffee may seem insignificant, but it really helps our page grow!
