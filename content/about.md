From FIDtenas, we seek to develop RF hardware using the most advanced state-of-the-art techniques to freely offer updated and optimized designs to radio amateurs and radio communications enthusiasts.

It is not the same to design an antenna for a fixed point-to-point link than to exploit propagation modes such as satellite, meteor scattering or aurora. Our experience in the amateur radio world enables us to optimize the specifications of our systems to those most needed by radio amateurs, in order to provide them with optimum performance in their final application.
