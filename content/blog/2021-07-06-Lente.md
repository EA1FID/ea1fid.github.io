In this post, we would like to share our design of a dielectric lens for the 10,5GHz band. It has been optimised for its use with commercial satellite dishes of f/D of 0,4, achieving optimal efficiency with respect to reflector illumination (-12dB of illumination at its edges). It can be 3D printed in PLA.




### Main features

The main characteristics of our dielectric lens are the following:

- **Cheap and easy to build:** you only need a 3D printer and some PLA to make one!

- **Optimal illumination of the dish:** this lens has been designed to offer around -12dB of illumination at the edges of the reflector, achieving this way an optimal performance

- **Compatible with 22mm waveguide:** designed to be used with widely-availabe 22mm metal tubing, which has become a standard in amateur radio users of the QO-100 satellite

- **Great bandwidth:** this lens includes a matching section to ensure a perfect resonance at 10,489GHz (central frequency of the QO-100 passband) and has wide enought bandwidth as for covering from 10GHz to 11GHz, allowing its use both in the entire 3cm amateur band and as a receiving satellite station for other GEO sats

### Build guide

>All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pepassaco/FIDtennas)

This is a very simple to build antenna. In order to make your own, you just have to:

1. Acquire a 22mm metal tube. This will be used as the waveguide connecting the antenna with the LNB. Copper is recommended (you may want to solder a patch antenna for the TX side in the future).

2. Print the dielectric lens. **Important:** use PLA with 100% infill. This ensures a good performance of the dielectric material, matching the simulations.

3. Introduce the waveguide in the dielectric lens to its end. It is as easy as that!

4. Enjoy!
