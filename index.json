[{"bands":["2m","70cm"],"categories":["Portable","Satellite"],"contents":"Today, we are glad to present you a very special antenna: Aiga.\nAiga is a double band VHF/UHF antenna designed for portable use. In this way, it uses extremely light materials in order to guarantee a confortable use during long satellite passes or SOTA activations. It has been specifically optimised for low elevation satellite passes, achieving good antenna gain while maintaining low side lobes levels for reducing the ammount of noise received.\nMain features This antenna has been designed with the objective of improving some aspects of other antennas from the market while adding new useful features for the radio operator.\n  Detachable elements: for improving the overall portability of the antenna, all of the elements (directors, reflectors and dipoles) are completely detachable! They fixing system has been design with the aim of offering an easy and fast solution, so that it is possible to assemble the whole antenna in under a minute.\n  Small size: the length of the longest element is 1000mm. Moreover, this antenna can be build with a 1000mm boom, so that it is easy to carry with you to wherever you plan to use it.\n  Easy to build: all the materials involved are easy to find in any hardware store. The plans of the 3D printed parts are also public so that anyone can print them at home.\n  Optimal performance: Aiga has been designed to offer huge bandwidth for both 2m and 70cm bands and a high gain without compromising the rest of the specifications.\n  VHF, UHF or both: both the 2m and 70cm parts of the antenna have been design fo offer a 50ohm impedance at its input, so that you can choose to assemble only one of the bands, assemble each one separately or both in the same boom.\n  No need of a diplexer: by choosing the adequate length for the transmission lines that start at the dipoles, we offer an innovative design that enables users to have two different connectors (one for each band) or directly connecting both of the outputs to a single connector without affecting the return loss of the antennae (more info below).\n  Choose any boom: Aiga has been design to be assembled with any boom, independently on whether it uses a non-conductive (fiberglass, PVC\u0026hellip;) or conductive (aluminum, titanum, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) material.\n  Antenna Specifications VHF    Specification Value Units     Gain 7.91 dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane) 62.8 º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane) 100 º   Efficiency 97.2 %   Impedance 50 Ω   Lowest SWR 1.03 -   Bandwidth 12.2 MHz    8.47 %   SLL (E plane) -18.4 dB   SLL (H plane) -18.5 dB   Polarization Linear -   XPD \u0026gt;60 dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR (very conesrvative measure).

Note that M4 will offer better consistency at the expense of increased weight.\n** 1000mm minimum recommended length (adapt to your needs). Can be any conductive or non-conductive tube.\n*** In our build, we will use RG-58 cable for convenience. However, if you have some light low-loss cable, there is no problem in using it instead\n**** 3D printable parts below are designed for M3 rods and round boom of 16mm of diammeter. They are easily editable for other setups.\nAssembly instructions The following points convey the insstructions to follow in case of assembling the full 2m/70cm bual band antenna. If you only want one of the bands, you must adjust the number of threaded rods, 3D printed parts and more according to your needs.\n All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our GitHub repository\n  This antenna has 11 elements. Hence, you will need to 3D-print 11 of the supports available in our repository. We recommend using low infill setting (around 10%, 20% at most) in order to achieve the lightest weight. Once they are printed, introduce one of the 30mm bolts through the corresponding hole and fix them with a wing nut without tightening them too much (see picture below).  Cut the threaded rods in the lengths described at our repository. The more precision you have, the better, specially for the 70cm antenna. Aiga has enought bandwidth in both of the bands as for not needing any tuning if build correctly!  Note: if you own a nanoVNA, you may be interested in cutting the dipoles a bit longer so that you can then tune the antenna according to you needs.\nAssemble the 3D printed supports with the elements.  Directors and reflector: introduce the rod through both of the remaining holes of the 3D printed support so that it rests just in the middle of it. Introduce one nut on each side of the threaded rod and tighten them (yes, you will need a bit of patience for the 2m elements).\nDipole: the same as with the rest of the elements, but introducing the element thought only one of the holes of the support.\n Cut exactly a multiple of λ/2 for both the 2m and for the 70cm sections. Note that the wavenlength inside the coax is different from the space free wavelength! For example, in the case of RG-58 coax, whose velocity factor is 0.66, the 2m coax wavelength is 1.375m, and, for the 70cm band, 0.455m. In our case, we decided to cut 1.375m of cable for the 2m band (one wavelength) and 1.365m of cable for the 70cm band (three wavelengths).\n  Peel around 3-4cm of coaxial cable wire (inner and outer conductors). Untighten a bit the outer nut of one of the legs of the dipole. Coil the wire around the threaded rod so that it makes a full lap around it. Cut any remaining piece of wire and screw the nut again, the more tight the better. Repeat the process with the other dipole leg. The result should look like the following picture:\n  Important: the coax with a length multiple of the 2m wavenegth must be connected to the 70cm dipole and viceversa. Scroll down to the Usage section for a detailed explanaiton about this.\nDraw some marks on the boom corresponding to the emplacement of the different elements, starting with the last 70cm director at the begining of the mast. Introduce the 3D printed supports with the elements though the boom to their corresponding location. You can now use the wing nut to tighten them on their corresponding location! After using the antenna, simply untighten the wing nut and take all the elements from the boom to disassemble the antenna.   Solder the corresponding SMA connectors.\n  Enjoy!\n  Usage This antenna can be used with two separate connectors, one for each band, and with a single connector as a dual-band antenna.\nFor the two connectors configuration, the length of the coax is not important, since both antennae are completely independent and will act as reparate radiant systems. However, for operating Aguia with a single connector, special attention must be paid with respect to the length of the transmission lines.\nOne of the main features of this design is that a diplexor is no longer needed for using the antenna with a single port. The way this works is by playing with the lengths of the coaxial lines.\nAssume we are connecting the 2m antenna to a 70cm transceiver. If we used arbitrarily long lines, the impedance of the antenna as seen from the connection port will vary depending on the length of the coax. While the reflection coefficient would be always 1 as seen from its input port, the impedance could be taking any value (even 0 or Infinity). In order to avoid this, we can use a half-wavelength length of coax, which ensures that the output at the output of the antenna will be exactly the same as at the output of the coax. Note, however, that, in this example, we are connecting a 70cm transceiver to the 2m antena. Then, the half-wavelength measure will have to be taken with respect to the 70cm band, since this will be the signal that will be traveling across the coax.\nIf, instead of connecting a single 2m antenna to a 70cm rig, we connected to the same port both a 70cm antenna and a 2m antenna, the rig would continue seeing an infinite impedance on the 2m branch, while a 50Ohm impedance on the 70cm one.\nInstead of a diplexer, a simple 2-female to 1-male T connector like the one shown in the following picture would suffice:\n","date":"27","image":"images/post/2021-08-08-Aiga/about.jpg","models":["Yagi"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-08-08-aiga/","tags":null,"title":"Project Aiga: a portable VHF/UHF antenna optimised for satellite work"},{"bands":["6m"],"categories":["Portable","Fixed"],"contents":"The successor of the Xurelo-4 is here! This time, we are bringing a new antenna for the 6m band: Xurelo-6.\nThe Meteor Scatter season is coming to its peak. While this propagation can be worked on higher frequencies, for the ones with a more modest setup, the 6m band is definitely the way to go. However, most of us cannot afford having a 6m directional antenna up in the ceiling of our houses, either for lack of space or for legal issues. As a solution, from FIDtenas we decided to design a new antenna by maintaining the same spirit we used for developing the Xurelo-4: having the specs of a 3-element yagi while offering fast and easy to assemble solution that can be used in portable activations!\nMain features This antenna has been designed with the objective of improving some aspects of other antennas from the market while adding new useful features for the radio operator.\n  Removable elements: in order to allow its use in portable situations, all of the elements are made out of 1m long threaded rods, so that they can fit inside even the smallest of the cars\n  Adapt it to your needs: Xurelo-6 can be built by using elements of diameters ranging from M4 to M16 without any significant change in performance: choose the diameter and material (threaded rod, aluminuum, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) to configure the antenna to your needs\n  Cheap and easy to build: all the materials involved are easy to find in any hardware store.

You can also use full-length aluminuum or carbon fiber tubes if you are looking for a more consistent setup or for a non-portable version.\n** Thanks to the 3D printed parts, the elements will be isolated from the boom. Hence, both conductive and non-conductive materials can be used.\n*** 3D printable parts below are designed for M6 rods and round boom of 16mm of diammeter.

Once printed, fix two of them to the threaded rod by screwing two M6 nuts and washers, one for each side.\n  Cut the remaining threaded rods in the lengths described at our repository. Assemble the director and reflector by using two threaded sleeve on each, one for each of the sides of the central rod as shown in the following picture:\n  Note: if you own a nanoVNA, you may be interested in cutting the dipoles a bit longer so that you can then tune the antenna according to you needs.\nAssemble the dipole similarly to the rest of the elements, but introducing the element though only one of the holes of the support.

Solder the SMA connector.\n  Enjoy!\n  Usage The portable version of Xurelo-6 (described above) uses M6 or M8 threaded rods for the elements. This can seem to bring a new issue into play: due to their length, they will inevitably bend a bit. However, the antenna has been modeled taking into account this bent and, due to its large curvature radius, it does not affect the performance of the antenna (neither the impedance match nor its gain), so you must not worry about it.\nWith respect to its height, it is recommended to place it at least 2,5m above ground in case of working in a location with relatively-high soil conductivity.\nFinally, recall that this antenna was not designed to be used in a fixed emplacement for extended periods of time. If you want to use it for this purpose, the length and spaceing of the different elements can be useful, but you will need to perform some modifications to the structure of the antenna in order to increase its mechanical consistency.\n","date":"20","image":"images/post/2021-07-30-Xurelo-6/model.png","models":["Yagi"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-30-xurelo-6/","tags":null,"title":"Xurelo-6: an easy and portable alternative for working the 50MHz / 6m band"},{"bands":["10GHz"],"categories":["Portable","Fixed"],"contents":"In this post, we would like to share our design of a dielectric lens for the 10,5GHz band.

However, it is part of a very interesting amateur radio experiment: designing smaller antennae that can achieve Earth-Moon-Earth communications.\nOne of the main characteristic of a small station for EME is its lack of a high output power capability. In order to compensate for this issue, amateur radio operators tend to search for those extra decibles in antenna gain. As such, they usually end up using either an array of two or four remarkably long (\u0026gt; 3m) yagis or a huge (\u0026gt;3.5m) parabolic disk in case of frequency bands above 23cm. These solutions exhibit a new problem: the need of notably large antennae.\nWhile large antennae will certainly get the job done, most of the people cannot install one at their QTH, either because of lack of space or because of legal issues. It is true that, in order to increase the gain of an antenna, there is no other solution than increasing also its size. Nevertheless, in this post, we are presenting an alternative procedure for achieving this goal: instead of using an array of few very large elements, using an array of numerous smaller antennae.\nThe size of the antenna must be enlarged in some way in order to increase its overall gain. What we propose is, instead of increasing it in only the z axis, what ends up being a set of few 3m-long yagis, it would be nice to extend it in both the x axis, the y axis and the z axis proportionally, creating a compact design that fits the basic requirements for EME communications. As a result, we came up with a new antenna array based on more but smaller elements.\nThe design First of all, from FIDtenas, we decided to design the radiant system of an EME station for the 23cm band for two main reasons. On the one hand, it is arguably the band with the greater number of users and big guns next to the 2m band. It is also growing extremely fast, so it is expected that the popularity of the 1.3GHz band ends up beating the 2m band soon. Second, because of the large number of resources that are available online for the amateur radio maker. From the cheap and easy to build power amplifiers based on the XRF286 to the easy to find transverters, it is definitely one of the bands where getting more than 100W is not expensive at all.\nWhen talking about our antenna, we must first justify the radiating element we are going to use. In our case, we decided to go for simple helical antennas. This is because they are easy to build, offer excellent specifications, they are super easy to tune (and offer enormous bandwidth) and they use circular polarization, as we need in order to work the 23cm band. As a drawback, since it is not possible to switch polarisation, we must build separate arrays for the transmitter and the receiver side. Nevertheless, the overall volume of the kit (3mx1.5mx0.5m) is still less than the volume of the parabollic reflector needed to obtain the same gain (2m of diameter, asuming a global efficiency of 70%), and we now have the ability of placing the transmitter and receiver subsystems at different places, transporting them easily for operating portable, a much lower wind loading and the capability of easily building such an antenna at home compared to a 2m parabolic reflector.\nThe array has been dimensioned to have a 4x4 element structure. All of the helical elements are placed in front of a continuous ground plane. While this ground plane has been modeled as a square piece of perfect electric conductor, in the reality, the use of a metal mesh is recommended, in order to reduce the wing loading of the structure.\nThe expert reader may have already noticed one of the problems of this antenna: shuch an array needs a feeding network. That\u0026rsquo;s completely true! However, we propose a very simple design that anyone can make with simple coaxial cable. This is posible thanks to the nominal impedance of an helix antenna being 140Ω instead of just 50Ω. More on this at the end of the page.\nFinally, from FIDtenas, we thought that some of our readers may have been interested in the design of a longer single-helix antenna. Consequently, we designed one! With a length of just over 1m, it offers an incredible gain. You may also try to use it for EME or other DX contacts! Its full specifications are shown in the section below.\nMain features The Ollomol antenna highlights some interesting new features:\n  Smallest size: the global size of the transmitting antenna is only 1.5mx1.5mx0.5m, offering twice the gain of a 6m-long yagi\n  Lowest noise: the increase in the number of elements of the array brings a huge increase in the Front/Back ratio and a small reduction in the Side Lobes Levels of the radiation pattern due to the inclusion of a bigger ground plane and the cancellation of spurious radiations of each individual element\n  Cheapest build: all of the materials needed for building this antenna can be bought at any hardware store. Moreover, the use of two different antennae for transmitting and receiving allows the user not to depend on a coaxial relay, connecting the TX side directly to the power amplifier and, the RX side, to an LNA and an SDR\n  Optimised for Amateur Radio: Ollomol has been design to offer fantastic specifications around the whole 23cm band\n  Antenna Specifications Ollomol 1296MHz / 23cm (Single element)    Specification Value Units     Gain 14.0 dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane) 34.2 º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane) 34.3 º   Efficiency 96.0 %   Impedance 140-50j Ω   Lowest SWR 1.4 -   Bandwidth 308 MHz    23 %   SLL (E plane) -13.8 dB   SLL (H plane) -13.6 dB   Polarization Circular -   XPD 20 dB   F/B 24.7 dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR (very conesrvative measure).

XPD is referred to broadside direction\n   Simulated radiation pattern Simulated SWR          Feeding network The feeding network is one of the most important and crucial parts of the antenna: not only will it connect all of the 16 radiating elements to a single port but also match the whole array to an impedance of 50Ω.\nSince we want an array with maximum gain and pointing towards the broadside direction, all the elements will be excited with exactly the same phase: all of the electrical lines from the input port to each of them must have the exact same electrical length. It is very important then to be very precise with the measures when cutting the coaxial lines.\nWithout further explaination, the network design can be seen in the following figures. Note that the 37,5Ω lines can be easily obtained by soldering in parallel two 75Ω sections of coaxial and tieing them together. Besides, the length of each section is specified below. Recall that tit is possible to cut the length in the specified base electrical length plus an exact multiple of λ/2. If you go for this, make sure that you maintain the same length on each side of the network, that is, the k parameter you choose remains constant for all the elements.\nFinally, remember that the wavelength inside the coax is different that the one in free space. Calculate first the wavelength in your coax (both the 50Ω one and the 75Ω one) before computing the desired length of each of the lines.\nOrange: line of length 0.47λ + k · λ/2 (for positive integer k)\nBlue: line of length 0.25λ + k · λ/2 (for positive integer k)\nBlack: these are not transmission lines and must not be implemented with any coax. That are just used as a referenece of the input impedance at that point. Increase the value of k in the aforementioned expressions if you need longer lines.\n   Rows connections Columns connections          As a basic explaination, an helical antenna has, at its central resonant frequency, an impedance of around 140Ω minus some imaginary part (capacitive loading). Our simulations show that, for values around 1296MHz, this impedance corresponds to 140-50jΩ. Then, the first step of the newtork is using a 0.47λ section to transform it to a real impedance of 165Ω. Afterwards, it is easy to obtain the desired impedances at each step by using classical λ/4 transformers, and obtaining a final impedance of 53,3Ω. Note that this corrresponds to a reflection coefficient of 0,03 or a SWR of just 1,06, with the final loss by impedance missmatch being only 0.004dB!\nAssembly and usage advices  All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our GitHub repository\n For this antenna, we will not provide any specific build instruction.

However, Raposo-2 and Raposo-2 Mini can be build by using a conductive boom separed at least 5mm from the antenna elements.

A metal mesh with big holes will not be seen as a good ground plane at these frequencies. Besides, avoind any wrinkles or knots in the final mount.\n  If you are planning to build the long single-helix version, recall that its input impedance is 150Ω. You may want to use a copper strip match to lower down this value before transmitting anything.\n  It is very important to follow the described procedure for assembling the feeding network. Otherwise, you may end up with incredibly high SWR values or degenerated radiation patterns.\n  ","date":"22","image":"images/post/2021-04-22-Ollomol/model_a.png","models":["Helix"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-04-22-ollomol/","tags":null,"title":"Ollmol: a modern approach to Small Station EME"},{"bands":["70cm"],"categories":["Fixed"],"contents":"Thanks to the experience obtaing thought the different design stages of Raposo-2, we are glad to annouce the new member to the family: Raposo-70.\nRaposo-70 is a LFA low-noise and high-gain yagi for the 70cm band.

Raposo-2 aims to be one of the first open-source projects that makes building ultra-high performance homemade LFA yagis possible for everybody.\nOne of the main advantages of the so-called LFA yagis is the use of a folded dipole as the active element instead of a Hertz dipole. This results in lower Side Lobes Levels, which, at the same time, translates to lower noise and interference levels.

Our Xurelo-2 antenna is fast to build, uses only easy to find materials and offers good specifications for working the 144MHz amateur band.\nMain features The following list summarises some of the main characteristics of Xurelo-2\n  Cheap and easy to DIY: following the do-it-yourself philosophy, Xurelo-2 has been design with the aim of using easy to find materials, ensuring all the necessary parts can be bought in any hardware store\n  Lightweight: while it is possible to build this antenna from different materials, the use of M3 threaded rods guarantees its light weight , making it perfect for portable or ocasional use\n  Optimised spects for Amatur Radio: Xurelo-4 is able to ofer good gain, Side Lobes Level and SWR across the whole 4m band\n  Balance between gain and length: we most of the times want antennae to offer the highest gain, but this comes with the expense of longer booms. One of the contraints of this design was using a boom that could fit inside a normal car\n  Detachable reflector: our design makes use of a detachable boom, which devides the antenna in two pieces (reflector and rest of the elements).

This should be replaced with propper materials such as fiberglass in order to use this antenna for extended periods of time or under extreme temperature conditions.\nAssembly instructions This instructions show the way we assembled the very first prototype of Xurelo-2. Note that a lot of steps can be improved, such as using some of the 3D-printable element supports from our repository instead of directly drilling the mast or designing a more durable transition between the coaxial cable and the dipole! The reader shall feel free to improve mechanical aspects of the design, always without modifying the electromagnetical properties of the antenna (use a non-conductive boom and respect the respective lengths and separations between elements).\n All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our GitHub repository\n  Cut the threaded rods in the lengths described at our repository.  Note: if you own a nanoVNA, you may be interested in cutting the dipoles a bit longer so that you can then tune the antenna according to you needs.\nDrill the boom at the places corresponding to the separation of the elements. Note that, for our design, we decided to use two different pieces of PVC tubing for the boom: one for the directors and active element and one for the reflector. This way, we can easily attach both legs of the dipole to the mast and we can disassemble the reflector to reduce the length of the antenna so that it fits inside smaller cars! See the pictures below as a reference:   Assemble the elements by passing them though the holes and fixing them with a couple of nuts and washers. Take special care for the dipole: both legs shall be parallel and colinear\n  Peel around 3-4cm of coaxial cable wire (inner and outer conductors). Untighten a bit the outer nut of one of the legs of the dipole. Coil the wire around the threaded rod so that it makes a full lap around it. Cut any remaining piece of wire and screw the nut again, the more tight the better. Repeat the process with the other dipole leg. The result should look like the following picture:\n  Solder the SMA connector.\n  Enjoy!\n  Usage This antenna is intended to be used for portable or ocasional operations. As such, it is built using cheap but non-durable materials. If the reader intends to use it as their primary antenna, we encourage him to use more costly but stronger materials.\nThe detachable reflector offers quite an advantage when it comes to transportation: this way, the antenna can fit inside most of cars without any problem. If you plan to use this antenna this way, we recommend placing it at least at 1,5m of height over the ground, so that the main lobe of the radiation pattern continues pointing to the broadside direction.\n","date":"14","image":"images/post/2020-08-14-Xurelo-2/fotaza.jpeg","models":["Yagi"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2020-08-14-xurelo-2/","tags":null,"title":"Xurelo-2: bringing 2m DX to everybody"},{"bands":["137MHz"],"categories":["Omnidirectional","Satellite"],"contents":"During my pursuit of the best antenna for receiving NOAA/Meteor images (I already built a Double-Cross antenna and a Turnstile), I decided to try a QFH antenna. I have always been a bit scared by QFHs because of their difficult construction: if you want a good symmetrical and rsistant antenna, you ought to use sopper tubing, which is difficult to bend and solder. However, some days ago I saw a tweet which gave me a pretty good idea: using some metal strip for the body of the helix.\nBill of materials The parts needed for building this awesome antenna are:\n Perforated metal strip. Any should get the job done, choose the one that fits better your needs. 5m will be enought. Threaded rod. You will need around 2m. See the plans below for the exact measures. Diameter is not very important (theoretically, the thicker, the more broadband the antenna will be). I chose 6mm rods (pretty standard and easy to find). PVC (or any other non conductive material) pipe. At least 70cm of pipe. However, this will be the mast of our antenna, so the taller, the better. Washers. For the diameter of the threaded rod. I bought a pack of 30. Nuts. The same sa the wathers. Coax cable. I used RG-58, since it was the cheapest. Make sure it is 50Ohm coax. Choose its length according to the length of the mast. SMA male connector. For the RG-58 cable.  Building When I was building this antenna, I had no clue about what the correct measures of each element would be. I took this website\u0026rsquo;s calculations as a reference, but I knew that, since the materials I was using were much different from the ones indicated there, that I would need to tune my antenna in order to achive an optimal performance. For this reason, I did not cut any of the elements the exact same length that website indicated, but a bit longer (around 1cm the rods and 2cm the metal strips), so that, after finishing the build, I would end up with an antenna tuned to a lower frequency and, with the help of a NanoVNA, I would be able to tune it to 137,5MHz by screwing the nuts and cutting the excess of metal. The, before giving the exact measures of my antenna, you must be aware that these lengths may not be the same for you, depending on the metal parts you buy (separation between holes or width of the metal strip, diameter of the rods\u0026hellip;).\nRecall that I used 6mm rods/nuts/washers and around 15mm wide (not uniform) metal strip with a hole each 20mm.\nThe antena is divided into two loops: one of them is tuned above the center frquency (2-3MHz above) and, the other one, under the center frequency (also around 2-3MHz).\n    Large loop Small loop     Heigh (mm) 765 730   Width (mm) 27,8 24,4   Length of strip (holes) 46 43   Length of strip (mm) 920 860   Separation of strip ends 295 245    Once you have cuted all the metal pieces accordingly, the assembly is pretty straightforward: simply drill the PCV pipe and introduce the rods with some nuts and washers to fix them. Recall that, at the bottom part of the helix, there are only 2 rods, while, at the top part, there should be 4 differents rods (the loops must be open, not a short circuit). After the assembly of the bars, insert the metal strip for the helix between two washers.\nFinally, it is important to connect correctly the coax to the antenna. For this purpose, I just cuted four 3cm long pieces of metal strip, made a small fissure on their center and introduced and soldered a cable thought it. Solder the coax to the corresponding cables and screw these parts to the antenna inside the PVC pipe.\nMeasuring and tuning the antenna After finishing the build (not with the measures from the table above, they are the definitive ones), I was time to measure the antenna (checking its SWR) and tuning it to the desired frequency (137,5MHz). This was the result of the very first test:\nSince the antenna was tuned to a much lower frequency, I screwed a bit each nut of each loop and studied the changes that this was producing on the antenna performance. After tweeking a lot all the nuts, I ended up with the following results:\nA SWR of only 1,016! That is crazy, so I could not wait for trying to receive some images from NOAA and Meteor satellites with my new setup.\nVery first images The performance of this antenna is just great: in spite of my bad location, it managed to achieve a lock and a clear constellation on a LRPT transmission at only 6º of elevation!\nNOAA satellites Signal at low elevation (10.5º) Signal at high elevation (54.1º) Images Meteor M2 Signal at low elevation (3.3º, bad propagation) Signal at high elevation (58.5º) Images Conclusion Definitely, this antenna offers a better performance than the Turnstile I made a while ago, and maybe even better thatn the double cross antenna too.\nNow, in order to further improve my results and being able to receive even lower satellite passes, I will need to continue optimising the rest of my setup. Maybe building a good bandpass filter for these frequencies could be the way to go!\n","date":"26","image":"images/post/2020-07-26-QFH/10.jpg","models":["QFH"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2020-07-26-qfh/","tags":null,"title":"A QFH antenna for NOAA and Meteor M2 satellites reception"}]
