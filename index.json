[{"bands":["2m","70cm"],"categories":["portable","satellite"],"contents":"Today, we are glad to present you a very special antenna: Aiga.\nAiga is a double band VHF/UHF antenna designed for portable use. In this way, it uses extremely light materials in order to guarantee a confortable use during long satellite passes or SOTA activations. It has been specifically optimised for low elevation satellite passes, achieving good antenna gain while maintaining low side lobes levels for reducing the ammount of noise received.\nMain features This antenna has been designed with the objective of improving some aspects of other antennas from the market while adding new useful features for the radio operator.\n  Detachable elements: for improving the overall portability of the antenna, all of the elements (directors, reflectors and dipoles) are completely detachable! They fixing system has been design with the aim of offering an easy and fast solution, so that it is possible to assemble the whole antenna in under a minute.\n  Small size: the length of the longest element is 1000mm. Moreover, this antenna can be build with a 1000mm boom, so that it is easy to carry with you to wherever you plan to use it.\n  Easy to build: all the materials involved are easy to find in any hardware store. The plans of the 3D printed parts are also public so that anyone can print them at home.\n  Optimal performance: Aiga has been designed to offer huge bandwidth for both 2m and 70cm bands and a high gain without compromising the rest of the specifications.\n  VHF, UHF or both: both the 2m and 70cm parts of the antenna have been design fo offer a 50ohm impedance at tis input, so that you can choose to assemble only one of the bands, assemble each one separately or both in the same boom.\n  No need of a diplexer: by choosing the adequate length for the transmission lines that start at the dipoles, we offer an innovative design that enables users to have two different connectors (one for each band) or directly connecting both of the outputs to a single connector without affecting the return loss of the antennae (more info below).\n  Choose any boom: Aiga has been design to be assembled with any boom, independently on whether it uses a non-conductive (fiberglass, PVC\u0026hellip;) or conductive (aluminum, titanum, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) material.\n  Antenna Specifications VHF    Specification Value Units     Gain  dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane)  º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane)  º   Efficiency  %   Impedance  Ω   Lowest SWR  -   Bandwidth  MHz     %   SLL (E plane)  dB   SLL (H plane)  dB   Polarization Linear -   XPD  dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR.\nUHF    Specification Value Units     Gain  dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane)  º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane)  º   Efficiency  %   Impedance  Ω   Lowest SWR  -   Bandwidth  MHz     %   SLL (E plane)  dB   SLL (H plane)  dB   Polarization Linear -   XPD  dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR.\nBill of materials Assembly instructions  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
