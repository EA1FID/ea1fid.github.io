[{"bands":["6m"],"categories":["Portable","Fixed"],"contents":"We are presenting our new antenna for the 4m / 70MHz band: Xurelo-4.\nThere is not a lot of people into the 4m band, mainly because of it not being allocated for Amateur Radio use in several contruies. For this reason, there is some lack of resources on the internet when it comes to homebrewing your own antennae, filters , amplifiers or transverters for this specific band. In an attempt to solve this, we would like to offer an antenna characterised by its simple design, cheap cost and facility to build, with the aim of encouraging new hams to get into this lovely band.\nMain features Xurelo-4 is a light antenna that can be used to operate the 4m band portable. Here are its main features:\n  Removable elements: in order to allow its use in portable situations, all of the elements are made out of 1m long threaded rods, so that they can fit inside even the smallest of the cars\n  Adapt it to your needs: while the following guide focus on an specific setup, this antenna can be built with tubes or rods of different diamenters, depending on whether you plan to use it for working portable or from home\n  Cheap and easy to build: all the materials involved are easy to find in any hardware store. The plans of the 3D printed parts are also public so that anyone can print them at home.\n  Optimised spects for Amatur Radio: Xurelo-4 is able to ofer good gain, Side Lobes Level and SWR across the whole 4m band\n  Choose any boom: Xurelo-6 has been design to be assembled with any boom, independently on whether it uses a non-conductive (fiberglass, PVC\u0026hellip;) or conductive (aluminum, titanum, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) material.\n  Antenna Specifications 70MHz / 4m    Specification Value Units     Gain 7.36 dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane) 66.5 º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane) 115.5 º   Efficiency 99.7 %   Impedance 50 Ω   Lowest SWR 1.1 -   Bandwidth 2.56 MHz    5.12 %   SLL (E plane) -18.2 dB   SLL (H plane) -18.2 dB   Polarization Linear -   XPD \u0026gt;70 dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR.

In order to build the detachable version shwon in this post, M6 threaded rods are recommended, since they offer a good balance between flex and weight. You can also use full-length aluminuum or carbon fiber tubes if you are looking for a more consistent setup or for a non-portable version.\n** Thanks to the 3D printed parts, the elements will be isolated from the boom. Hence, both conductive (aluminum, titanium, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) and non-conductive (fiberglass, PVC\u0026hellip;) materials can be used.\n*** 3D printable parts below are designed for M6 rods and round boom of 16mm of diammeter. They are easily editable for other setups.\nAssembly instructions The following points refer to the portable version of the antenna, made out of M6 threaded rods. Recall that it is also possible to choose other materials for using this antenna in a non-portable way.\n All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our GitHub repository\n  Cut the threaded rods in the lengths described at our repository.  Note: if you own a nanoVNA, you may be interested in cutting the dipoles a bit longer so that you can then tune the antenna according to you needs.\n Print three of the element supports using high enought infill (around 20% or more in case of using different materials). Once printed, take two of them (director and reflector) and introduce a threaded sleeve at the center hole of the printed part. Then, screw one threaded rods on each side of the sleeve, so that they fit inside the lateral holes of the printed supports. Once they are tight, use a nut and a washer to fix each side of the element\n  Assemble the dipole similarly to the rest of the elements, but introducing the rod though only one of the holes of the support. Fix each leg of the dipole by using two nuts (one inside the support and one outside it).\n  Peel around 3-4cm of coaxial cable wire (inner and outer conductors). Untighten a bit the outer nut of one of the legs of the dipole. Coil the wire around the threaded rod so that it makes a full lap around it. Cut any remaining piece of wire and screw the nut again, the more tight the better. Repeat the process with the other dipole leg. The result should look like the following picture:  Draw some marks on the boom corresponding to the emplacement of the different elements, starting with the last 70cm director at the begining of the mast. Drill M4 holes corresponding to their corerct emplacement across the boom. Assemble the three elements by using the M4 bolts, the washers and the wing nuts.   Solder the SMA connector.\n  Enjoy!\n  Usage The portable version of Xurelo-4 (described above) uses M6 threaded rods for the elements. This, together with the use of the threaded sleeves, ensures that there is a good electrical connection between the different rods that make up an element while offering an easy way to disassemble the antenna and pack it home. There is no excuses to take this in your car and start working this new band!\nWith respect to its height, it is recommended to place it at least 1,75m above ground in case of working in a location with relatively-high soil conductivity.\nFinally, recall that this antenna was not designed to be used in a fixed emplacement for extended periods of time. If you want to use it for this purpose, the length and spaceing of the different elements can be useful, but you will need to perform some modifications to the structure of the antenna in order to increase its mechanical consistency.\n","date":"15","image":"images/post/2021-06-15-Xurelo-4/model.png","models":["Yagi"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-06-15-xurelo-4/","tags":null,"title":"Xurelo-4: working the 70MHz / 4m band on-the-go"},{"bands":["2m","70cm"],"categories":["Portable","Satellite"],"contents":"Today, we are glad to present you a very special antenna: Aiga.\nAiga is a double band VHF/UHF antenna designed for portable use. In this way, it uses extremely light materials in order to guarantee a confortable use during long satellite passes or SOTA activations. It has been specifically optimised for low elevation satellite passes, achieving good antenna gain while maintaining low side lobes levels for reducing the ammount of noise received.\nMain features This antenna has been designed with the objective of improving some aspects of other antennas from the market while adding new useful features for the radio operator.\n  Detachable elements: for improving the overall portability of the antenna, all of the elements (directors, reflectors and dipoles) are completely detachable! They fixing system has been design with the aim of offering an easy and fast solution, so that it is possible to assemble the whole antenna in under a minute.\n  Small size: the length of the longest element is 1000mm. Moreover, this antenna can be build with a 1000mm boom, so that it is easy to carry with you to wherever you plan to use it.\n  Easy to build: all the materials involved are easy to find in any hardware store. The plans of the 3D printed parts are also public so that anyone can print them at home.\n  Optimal performance: Aiga has been designed to offer huge bandwidth for both 2m and 70cm bands and a high gain without compromising the rest of the specifications.\n  VHF, UHF or both: both the 2m and 70cm parts of the antenna have been design fo offer a 50ohm impedance at its input, so that you can choose to assemble only one of the bands, assemble each one separately or both in the same boom.\n  No need of a diplexer: by choosing the adequate length for the transmission lines that start at the dipoles, we offer an innovative design that enables users to have two different connectors (one for each band) or directly connecting both of the outputs to a single connector without affecting the return loss of the antennae (more info below).\n  Choose any boom: Aiga has been design to be assembled with any boom, independently on whether it uses a non-conductive (fiberglass, PVC\u0026hellip;) or conductive (aluminum, titanum, carbon fiber\u0026hellip;) material.\n  Antenna Specifications VHF    Specification Value Units     Gain 7.91 dBi   3 dB Beamwidth (E plane) 62.8 º   3 dB Beamwidth (H plane) 100 º   Efficiency 97.2 %   Impedance 50 Ω   Lowest SWR 1.03 -   Bandwidth 12.2 MHz    8.47 %   SLL (E plane) -18.4 dB   SLL (H plane) -18.5 dB   Polarization Linear -   XPD \u0026gt;60 dB    Note: bandwidth is measured between points at 1.5 SWR.

Can be any conductive or non-conductive tube.\n*** In our build, we will use RG-58 cable for convenience. However, if you have some light low-loss cable, there is no problem in using it instead\n**** 3D printable parts below are designed for M3 rods and round boom of 16mm of diammeter. They are easily editable for other setups.\nAssembly instructions The following points convey the insstructions to follow in case of assembling the full 2m/70cm bual band antenna. If you only want one of the bands, you must adjust the number of threaded rods, 3D printed parts and more according to your needs.\n All of the measurements, plans, .stl files and more can be found in our GitHub repository\n  This antenna has 11 elements. Hence, you will need to 3D-print 11 of the supports available in our repository. We recommend using low infill setting (around 10%, 20% at most) in order to achieve the lightest weight. Once they are printed, introduce one of the 30mm bolts through the corresponding hole and fix them with a wing nut without tightening them too much (see picture below).  Cut the threaded rods in the lengths described at our repository. The more precision you have, the better, specially for the 70cm antenna. Aiga has enought bandwidth in both of the bands as for not needing any tuning if build correctly!  Note: if you own a nanoVNA, you may be interested in cutting the dipoles a bit longer so that you can then tune the antenna according to you needs.\nAssemble the 3D printed supports with the elements.  Directors and reflector: introduce the rod through both of the remaining holes of the 3D printed support so that it rests just in the middle of it. Introduce one nut on each side of the threaded rod and tighten them (yes, you will need a bit of patience for the 2m elements).\nDipole: the same as with the rest of the elements, but introducing the element thought only one of the holes of the support.\n Cut exactly a multiple of λ/2 for both the 2m and for the 70cm sections. Note that the wavenlength inside the coax is different from the space free wavelength! For example, in the case of RG-58 coax, whose velocity factor is 0.66, the 2m coax wavelength is 1.375m, and, for the 70cm band, 0.455m. In our case, we decided to cut 1.375m of cable for the 2m band (one wavelength) and 1.365m of cable for the 70cm band (three wavelengths).\n  Peel around 3-4cm of coaxial cable wire (inner and outer conductors). Untighten a bit the outer nut of one of the legs of the dipole. Coil the wire around the threaded rod so that it makes a full lap around it. Cut any remaining piece of wire and screw the nut again, the more tight the better. Repeat the process with the other dipole leg. The result should look like the following picture:\n  Important: the coax with a length multiple of the 2m wavenegth must be connected to the 70cm dipole and viceversa. Scroll down to the Usage section for a detailed explanaiton about this.\nDraw some marks on the boom corresponding to the emplacement of the different elements, starting with the last 70cm director at the begining of the mast. Introduce the 3D printed supports with the elements though the boom to their corresponding location. You can now use the wing nut to tighten them on their corresponding location! After using the antenna, simply untighten the wing nut and take all the elements from the boom to disassemble the antenna.   Solder the corresponding SMA connectors.\n  Enjoy!\n  Usage This antenna can be used with two separate connectors, one for each band, and with a single connector as a dual-band antenna.\nFor the two connectors configuration, the length of the coax is not important, since both antennae are completely independent and will act as reparate radiant systems. However, for operating Aguia with a single connector, special attention must be paid with respect to the length of the transmission lines.\nOne of the main features of this design is that a diplexor is no longer needed for using the antenna with a single port. The way this works is by playing with the lengths of the coaxial lines.\nAssume we are connecting the 2m antenna to a 70cm transceiver. If we used arbitrarily long lines, the impedance of the antenna as seen from the connection port will vary depending on the length of the coax. While the reflection coefficient would be always 1 as seen from its input port, the impedance could be taking any value (even 0 or Infinity). In order to avoid this, we can use a half-wavelength length of coax, which ensures that the output at the output of the antenna will be exactly the same as at the output of the coax. Note, however, that, in this example, we are connecting a 70cm transceiver to the 2m antena. Then, the half-wavelength measure will have to be taken with respect to the 70cm band, since this will be the signal that will be traveling across the coax.\nIf, instead of connecting a single 2m antenna to a 70cm rig, we connected to the same port both a 70cm antenna and a 2m antenna, the rig would continue seeing an infinite impedance on the 2m branch, while a 50Ohm impedance on the 70cm one.\nInstead of a diplexer, a simple 2-female to 1-male T connector like the one shown in the following picture would suffice:\n","date":"27","image":"images/post/2021-07-27-Aiga/about.jpg","models":["Yagi"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2021-07-27-aiga/","tags":null,"title":"Project Aiga: a portable VHF/UHF antenna optimised for satellite work"},{"bands":["137MHz"],"categories":["Omnidirectional","Satellite"],"contents":"During my pursuit of the best antenna for receiving NOAA/Meteor images (I already built a Double-Cross antenna and a Turnstile), I decided to try a QFH antenna. I have always been a bit scared by QFHs because of their difficult construction: if you want a good symmetrical and rsistant antenna, you ought to use sopper tubing, which is difficult to bend and solder. However, some days ago I saw a tweet which gave me a pretty good idea: using some metal strip for the body of the helix.\nBill of materials The parts needed for building this awesome antenna are:\n Perforated metal strip. Any should get the job done, choose the one that fits better your needs. 5m will be enought. Threaded rod. You will need around 2m. See the plans below for the exact measures. Diameter is not very important (theoretically, the thicker, the more broadband the antenna will be). I chose 6mm rods (pretty standard and easy to find). PVC (or any other non conductive material) pipe. At least 70cm of pipe. However, this will be the mast of our antenna, so the taller, the better. Washers. For the diameter of the threaded rod. I bought a pack of 30. Nuts. The same sa the wathers. Coax cable. I used RG-58, since it was the cheapest. Make sure it is 50Ohm coax. Choose its length according to the length of the mast. SMA male connector. For the RG-58 cable.  Building When I was building this antenna, I had no clue about what the correct measures of each element would be. I took this website\u0026rsquo;s calculations as a reference, but I knew that, since the materials I was using were much different from the ones indicated there, that I would need to tune my antenna in order to achive an optimal performance. For this reason, I did not cut any of the elements the exact same length that website indicated, but a bit longer (around 1cm the rods and 2cm the metal strips), so that, after finishing the build, I would end up with an antenna tuned to a lower frequency and, with the help of a NanoVNA, I would be able to tune it to 137,5MHz by screwing the nuts and cutting the excess of metal. The, before giving the exact measures of my antenna, you must be aware that these lengths may not be the same for you, depending on the metal parts you buy (separation between holes or width of the metal strip, diameter of the rods\u0026hellip;).\nRecall that I used 6mm rods/nuts/washers and around 15mm wide (not uniform) metal strip with a hole each 20mm.\nThe antena is divided into two loops: one of them is tuned above the center frquency (2-3MHz above) and, the other one, under the center frequency (also around 2-3MHz).\n    Large loop Small loop     Heigh (mm) 765 730   Width (mm) 27,8 24,4   Length of strip (holes) 46 43   Length of strip (mm) 920 860   Separation of strip ends 295 245    Once you have cuted all the metal pieces accordingly, the assembly is pretty straightforward: simply drill the PCV pipe and introduce the rods with some nuts and washers to fix them. Recall that, at the bottom part of the helix, there are only 2 rods, while, at the top part, there should be 4 differents rods (the loops must be open, not a short circuit). After the assembly of the bars, insert the metal strip for the helix between two washers.\nFinally, it is important to connect correctly the coax to the antenna. For this purpose, I just cuted four 3cm long pieces of metal strip, made a small fissure on their center and introduced and soldered a cable thought it. Solder the coax to the corresponding cables and screw these parts to the antenna inside the PVC pipe.\nMeasuring and tuning the antenna After finishing the build (not with the measures from the table above, they are the definitive ones), I was time to measure the antenna (checking its SWR) and tuning it to the desired frequency (137,5MHz). This was the result of the very first test:\nSince the antenna was tuned to a much lower frequency, I screwed a bit each nut of each loop and studied the changes that this was producing on the antenna performance. After tweeking a lot all the nuts, I ended up with the following results:\nA SWR of only 1,016! That is crazy, so I could not wait for trying to receive some images from NOAA and Meteor satellites with my new setup.\nVery first images The performance of this antenna is just great: in spite of my bad location, it managed to achieve a lock and a clear constellation on a LRPT transmission at only 6º of elevation!\nNOAA satellites Signal at low elevation (10.5º) Signal at high elevation (54.1º) Images Meteor M2 Signal at low elevation (3.3º, bad propagation) Signal at high elevation (58.5º) Images Conclusion Definitely, this antenna offers a better performance than the Turnstile I made a while ago, and maybe even better thatn the double cross antenna too.\nNow, in order to further improve my results and being able to receive even lower satellite passes, I will need to continue optimising the rest of my setup. Maybe building a good bandpass filter for these frequencies could be the way to go!\n","date":"26","image":"images/post/2020-07-26-QFH/10.jpg","models":["QFH"],"permalink":"https://www.fidtenas.ga/blog/2020-07-26-qfh/","tags":null,"title":"A QFH antenna for NOAA and Meteor M2 satellites reception"}]
